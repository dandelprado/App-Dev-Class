# Introduction to Web Graphics Library

You can utilize HTML and CSS for making simple shapes and animations. However, if you need to generate more challenging imagess or animations, HTML and CSS simply will be insufficient. 

In 2004, Appled introduced the `<canvas>` tag to the JavaScript language, allowing you to draw 2D shapes and bitmaps over specific areas of your browser. However, you can't create 3D forms, textures, or animations. In 2009, the **Khronos Group** collaborated with Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Opera to develop the WebGL technology, which allows complex 3D graphics to be displayed in web browsers.

WebGL allows the application of physics, image processing, and effects as part of the web page canvas at a GPU speed without the requirement for plug-ins. This was a major breakthrough in the ongoing efforts by developers and designers to create more captivating web page designs and interactions. 

A year later, Three.js, a WebGL library that enables developers to employ advanced graphic capabilities with simply JavaScript was launched. 

## Three.js History

*Ricardo Cabello* produced Three.js, which was initially written in Flash ActionScript before being translated to JavaScript. Three.js' first official version, released in 2010, was completely cross-browser and did not require any plugins. Three.js is a real-time render engine, which means it uses multiple methods to create a complex 3D scenes on your browser's screen. There are benefits and drawbacks to utilizing alternate renderings, and the most major advantage of using Three.js is **the ability to have a 3D scene ready to run on (almost) any browser or device, without the need to download or install anything, and with no compatibility difficulties.** Unlike Unity and Unreal Engine, which are separate software that may utilize the computer's GPU directly. Currently, Three.js is **the most popular 3D library.**

## Three.js Alternatives

1. PlayCanvas (https://playcanvas.com/)

- open source PlayCanvas HTML5 game engine, built on WebGL and GITF, for building games, playable ads, visualizations, VR and AR. 

2. Unity WebGL (https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/webgl-gettingstarted.html)

- feature of the Unity game engine that allows develoeprs to create and publish 3D games or interactive content directly to web browsers, utilizing the WebGL (Web Graphics Library) standard to render graphics within the borwser without the need for additional plugins, allowing users to play Unity-developed content directly on a webpage.

3. Babylon.js (https://www.babylonjs.com/)

- free, open-source gaming framework that streamlines WebGL capabilities, allowing you to create 3D games and apps that run on any broswer with a GPU device. 

### Extending Three.js

1. React Three Fiber, or R3F (https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction)

- React framework based on THree.js that allows React developers to use Three.js with reusable components and is fully integrated into React core. It includes a large number of native components and allows users to use pure Three.js code if necessary. 

2. A-Frame (https://aframe.io/)

- HTML framework, built on Three.js, enables developers to create 3D scenarios with minimal code and complexity. It is mostly used for web AR and VR apps and supports both pure Three.js and A-frame code.

### Tools and Requisites to Start Developing

1. Code Editor
2. Local Server

- Live Server (VSCode Extension)

3. Web Browser
