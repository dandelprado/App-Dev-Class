# Application Development Class Notes

This repository contains the lessons, provided coding exercises(boilerplates), and completed coding activities for our **Application Development** class which focuses mainly on the usage of three.js library for 3D graphics and animations. The contents are organized into **Prelims, Midterms, and Finals(once available)** folders. Each folder contains the lessons and coding exercises for the respective period.

## Running the Code

To run the HTML and JavaScript files in this repository, you can use **VS Code's Live Server extension** or **Neovim with live-server (personal choice)**.

### **Option 1: Using VS Code Live Server**
1. Install the **Live Server** extension in VS Code.
2. Open the repository folder in VS Code.
3. Right click on the HTML file and select **Open with Live Server**. Or click the **Go Live** button at the bottom right corner of the window.

### **Option 2: Using Neovim**
1. Install the [`tapio/live-server`](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) plugin using your preferred plugin manager. I'm using **Lazy** since I find it the easiest to work with across the different plugin I am using.
2. Follow the installation instructions from the plugin page.
3. Once installed, navigate to the root of the project and run:
```sh
live-server
```

#### **Note:**
- Repository will be updated with **Finals** content during Finals. LOL.
- Suggestions are welcome.
